An agent is just something that acts. They are however expected not only to do something, but rather to do more: operate autonomously, perceive environment, persist over a time period, adapt, change, create and pursue goals. Therefore, a rational agent is an agent that acts with the goal to achieve the best (expected) outcome.

The rational agent approach has two advantages over the other approaches. First, it is more general than the “laws of thought” approach, because correct inference is just one of several possible mechanisms for achieving rationality. Second, it is oriented towards scientific development than to other approaches. The standard of rationality is mathematically well defined and completely general. Human behaviour, on the other hand, is well adapted for one specific environment and is defined by the sum of all the things that humans do.
