Symbolic AI represents all methods in AI research that are based on human-readable symbols. These symbols represent the problem logics and searches. Symbolic AI was dominant between 1950s and 1980s, until a new approach was introduced, namely the sub-symbolic approach. Symbolic AI was intended to produce general, human-like intelligence in a machine, whereas most modern research is directed at specific sub-problems. The sub-symbolic approach is based among others on neural networks, statistics and numerical optimisation.

Nowadays, the majority of AI applications employ sub-symbolic techniques, while symbolic techniques are rarely used or used in some smaller domains such as knowledge representation and expert system.

The most successful form of symbolic AI are the expert systems, which use production rules, connecting symbols in a relationship similar to an If-Then statement. The expert system processes the rules to decide if it needs any additional information, if yes then which, what questions to ask, while using human-readable symbols.

In the book “Artificial Intelligence: The very Idea”, John Haugeland (1985) refers to symbolic AI as to GOFAI which means “Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence”.
