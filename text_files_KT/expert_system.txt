Expert systems are one possible realization of a knowledge based system. They model higher cognitive functions of the human brain. They are often used to mimic the human decision-making process. The algorithms used in expert systems are often static, which means that it provides a specific degree of certainty. However, this also means they cannot learn from experience.
When looking at expert systems in a more detailed fashion, we can identify four main elements of an expert system.

Acquisition module (input by external expert and database)
Empty KB (input specific knowledge)
Inference engine (derive decisions from knowledge and be able to justify them)
Explanatory interface (which enlightens the user)

The acquisition module processes the input of one or multiple experts as well as a database. To make the knowledge acquisition process easier, the expert(s) usually focus on a very specific, narrow topic.

The received information is then fed into a knowledge base. For example, the acquisition module can be a human knowledge engineer who inserts the information received by the domain expert into the knowledge base. They usually do this by organizing the information into a set of rules, e.g. of an ‘if-then’ structure. These kinds of rules are also called production rules.

This is also important for the inference engine algorithms to produce the best possible results. The algorithms infer meaning from the data provided in the knowledge base and derive decisions.

These decisions are then displayed through an explanatory interface to the user.

A professionally created and well-maintained expert system can become a substitute for a domain expert. This only applies to very specific areas of knowledge
