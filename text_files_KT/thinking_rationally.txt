One of the first approaches of how to attempt codifying “right thinking” was done by Aristotle, a Greek philosopher. His work provided base for structures that always provided correct results when given correct premises (“Socrates is a man; all men are mortal; therefore, Socrates is mortal”). These laws governing the operation of the mind initiated the field called logic. In 1965, there were developed some programs, which were able to solve any problem, if it was completely described in logical notation. They formed a base for building artificial intelligence with the goal to create more and better intelligent systems.

However, there are two main obstacles to this approach. First, it is extremely difficult to represent informal knowledge in logical notation. This is also the case if the knowledge is 100% certain. Second, solving a problem in theory is not the same as solving a problem in practice. Many logical operations and problems tend to exhaust the current computer resources (especially in earlier years).
