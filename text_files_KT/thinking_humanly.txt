To be able to develop a program that thinks like a human, we first need to find out how humans think. This can be done by carrying out the following actions:

Introspection – trying to catch our own thoughts as they appear
Psychological experiments – observing a person in action
Brain imaging – observing the brain in action
Once there is a sufficient precise theory of how a brain works, it could be expressed through a computer program. If program’s behaviour expresses human behaviour, then the goal is achieved and the program operates like a human.
